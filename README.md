# SafetyWatch

Project for Accenture TDP Hackathon 2019.

This will be used as the front-end for SafetyWatch and will serve as a map to locate all reported crime in the surrounding areas. Crimes will be reported through either the website or an Alexa skill that funnels the Crimetype, location, time and userID into a database stored in AWS. This data is purged every week to keep the map up to date.
